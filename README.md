This is the firmware for the microspora board, a compact motor driver board based on the DRV8316 IC and an STM32G4 series microcontroller, and MT6701 encoder. The board is designed for BLDC motors under 10Amps, and is compatible with the SimpleFOC library. It is super compact and it seems to be a very very nice fit to start with SimpleFOC!

It can be used for torque, velocity and position control.
